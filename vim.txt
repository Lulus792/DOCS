:<number of line>                   # jumps to the given line     
:%s/word/newword/g                  # replaces in whole file word with newword
    ##### % only if in whole file otherwise select the lines before #####


! every command can be combined with numbers before
number <command>
example:
    10u                              # undo the last 10 things
    10h                              # goes 10 charecter left
    10p                             # pasting 10 times
    10w                             # jumps 10 words
    etc.
